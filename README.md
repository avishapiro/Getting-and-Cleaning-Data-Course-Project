# Project for Johns Hopkins Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course

The main script to process the raw data and create a tidy data set is in file run_analysis.R. 

The script will download and uncompress the raw data if not present from [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

The final tidy data set is output to tidy_data.txt.

A description of the tidy data set and how it was obtained from the raw data is found in CodeBook.md.
